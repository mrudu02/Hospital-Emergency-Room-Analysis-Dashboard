# Project 5: Hospital-Emergency-Room-Analysis-Dashboard

This project focuses on analyzing and optimizing emergency room (ER) operations using Power BI. The dashboard provides key insights into patient flow, wait times, satisfaction scores, and referrals to enhance hospital efficiency and decision-making.

* Analyzed daily ER visits to identify peak hours and seasonal trends.
* Monitored patient wait times to detect inefficiencies.
* Evaluated patient satisfaction scores and their correlation with service delays.
* Identified departments with high patient referrals to optimize resource allocation.
* Improved ER management through data-driven insights and visual storytelling.

Key Insights:
* Identified busiest days and hours for strategic staffing.
* Highlighted times when patients experience the longest delays.
* Correlated low satisfaction scores with high wait times.
* Analyzed patient distribution by age, gender, and race.

Tools: 
**Power BI**: Interactive visual analytics and dashboards.
**DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: For custom calculations and KPIs.
